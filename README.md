# blakecreates-sample1 - Hair Salon
A fake Hair Salon website as a sample to show clients. Currently WIP.

###### To Do List
- [x] Outline layout for hair salon
- [x] Build out HTML
- [x] Build Out CSS
- [ ] Find some ways to input JavaScript (Rotating testimonials, maybe?)
- [ ] Make site responsive for smaller browsers, tablets, and mobile

###### The Process
I usually start by psuedo-coding the layout of the website so I can get a better feel for how exactly I'm wanting to construct it. Sometimes I'll add and remove things as I go, but for the most part I find a layout I'm happy with and stick to it while I build the bones of the site.
